Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1. You must write a program with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Input Format

The first line contains N.
Next line contains N integers of the array.
The next line contains the key to be searched. 

Constraints

• 1 <= nums.length <= 104 • -104 < nums[i], target < 104 • All the integers in nums are unique. • nums is sorted in ascending order

Output Format

Single Interger index or -1.
